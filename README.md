## Logseq timeflow plugin

Why do we need such a plugin?

I am accustomed to using logseq for daily logging, and I like to add timestamps at the beginning of each entry.
This way, when I review what I've done throughout the day in the evening, I can see where my time has been spent.
I find this habit very intuitive and often feel how time flies, which makes me plan my time more meticulously. I'm sharing this with everyone, hoping you'll like it as much as I do.
